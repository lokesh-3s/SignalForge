## 🔄 Workflow: How It Works

### Step 1: User Creates Email Node
1. User adds an email node to the campaign workflow
2. Node displays with purple theme and Mail icon
3. CSV upload section appears in idle state

### Step 2: Upload Email List
1. User clicks "Upload Email List (CSV)" button
2. File picker opens (accepts .csv files only)
3. File uploads to `/api/email/parse-csv`
4. API validates and parses CSV:
   - Checks file type
   - Parses with PapaParse library
   - Validates email format
   - Extracts names if available
5. Returns email list with statistics
6. Email list stored in node data via `updateNodeData()`
7. UI updates to show "X emails loaded"

### Step 3: Run Email Node
1. User clicks "Run Agent" button
2. Node status changes to "loading"
3. Execution flow:
   - Build execution context from connected nodes
   - Compile prompt with campaign context
   - Generate email content using Gemini AI
   - Parse JSON response (subject, html, text)
   - Retrieve email list from node data
   - Call `/api/email/send-bulk` with content + list
   - Bulk sending via Resend API
   - Personalize emails with {{name}} placeholders
   - Track success/failure rates

### Step 4: Display Results
1. Node status changes to "complete"
2. Output shows:
   - ✅ Success message
   - Email subject
   - Sent/total statistics
   - Failed emails (if any)
   - Preview of recipients

## 🔑 Environment Variables Required

Users must configure these in `.env.local`:

```env
# Required
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Recommended (defaults to onboarding@resend.dev if not set)
EMAIL_FROM="Your Company <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
```

---

## 📋 CSV Format Specifications

### Minimum Requirements
- Must have `email` column (case-insensitive)
- One email per row
- Valid email format: `name@domain.com`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload valid CSV file with email and name columns
- [ ] Upload CSV with only email column (no names)
- [ ] Upload invalid CSV (wrong format)
- [ ] Upload non-CSV file (should reject)
- [ ] Test with empty CSV
- [ ] Test with large CSV (100+ emails)
- [ ] Run email node with uploaded list
- [ ] Run email node without uploaded list (should show warning)
- [ ] Verify AI-generated content quality
- [ ] Verify personalization with {{name}}
- [ ] Check sent/failed statistics
- [ ] Test with invalid Resend API key (should error gracefully)
- [ ] Test without EMAIL_FROM set (should use default)

---

## 📊 Rate Limits & Quotas

### Resend Free Tier
- **100 emails/day**
- **3,000 emails/month**
- Test sender: `onboarding@resend.dev`

### System Rate Limiting
- **Batch size:** 100 emails per batch
- **Delay:** 100ms between individual emails
- **Prevents:** API rate limit errors

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- ✅ Store in `.env.local` (never commit)
- ✅ Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Rotate keys periodically
- ✅ Use different keys for dev/prod

### Email Privacy
- ✅ Validate email lists before upload
- ✅ Don't store CSV files in repo
- ✅ Comply with GDPR/CAN-SPAM
- ✅ Only email users with permission

### Input Validation
- ✅ File type validation (CSV only)
- ✅ Email format validation (regex)
- ✅ File size limits (via form data)
- ✅ Error handling for malformed CSV

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Free tier limits:** 100 emails/day with Resend free account
2. **Test domain:** `onboarding@resend.dev` may trigger spam filters
3. **No scheduling:** Emails sent immediately when node runs
4. **No A/B testing:** Single email version per execution
5. **CSV size:** Browser upload limits (typically 5-10MB)
6. **No email templates:** AI generates content from scratch each time

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Email Templates:** Pre-designed HTML templates
2. **Scheduling:** Delayed/scheduled sending
3. **A/B Testing:** Multiple subject/content variations
4. **Analytics:** Open rates, click tracking
5. **Segmentation:** Filter recipients based on criteria
6. **Attachments:** Support file attachments
7. **Preview Mode:** Preview before sending
8. **Draft Mode:** Save without sending
9. **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry for failed sends
10. **Unsubscribe:** Built-in unsubscribe handling
