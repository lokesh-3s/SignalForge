## 🚀 Setup Steps (DO THESE NOW)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd E:\Redact2025\ChainForecast-Next-App
npm install reactflow lucide-react
```

### Step 2: Verify MongoDB Schema
The User model should have `predictionLogs` array with this structure:
```javascript
predictionLogs: [{
  predictionId: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  forecast: {
    totalPredicted: Number,
    dailyPredictions: [{ day, date, predicted }],
    metrics: { mae, errorPercentage }
  },
  blockchain: {
    transactionHash: String,
    timestamp: Number,
    domain: String
  },
  merkleTree: {
    root: String,
    leaves: [...],
    hierarchicalStructure: {
      root: String,
      total_levels: Number,
      total_leaves: Number,
      levels: [[...]]
    }
  }
}]
```
✅ **Already done** - User.js has been updated

### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
Verify `.env.local` contains:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://lamaq-chainforecast.hf.space
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test the Implementation
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. Check if sidebar appears on the left
3. Click the toggle button to open/close
4. Upload a CSV to create a prediction (if you don't have any)
5. Click "Expand Tree" on a prediction card
6. Click any green leaf node
7. Verify proof path highlights in red

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

### Visual Checks
- [ ] Sidebar appears on left side of dashboard
- [ ] Toggle button is visible and clickable
- [ ] Sidebar slides smoothly when toggled
- [ ] Prediction cards display correctly
- [ ] Transaction hashes and Merkle roots are visible
- [ ] Copy buttons work for hashes
- [ ] "Expand Tree" button is visible

### Functionality Checks
- [ ] Predictions fetch from `/api/user/predictions`
- [ ] Refresh button fetches new data
- [ ] Cards expand to show Merkle Tree
- [ ] Tree renders with correct node colors:
  - Green = Leaf nodes
  - Blue = Intermediate nodes
  - Purple = Root node
- [ ] Leaf nodes are clickable
- [ ] Clicking leaf node fetches proof
- [ ] Proof path highlights in red
- [ ] Verification steps display at bottom
- [ ] Mini-map shows on tree
- [ ] Zoom/pan controls work

### Data Flow Checks
- [ ] User authentication works (must be logged in)
- [ ] MongoDB connection successful
- [ ] Predictions data has correct structure
- [ ] `hierarchicalStructure` exists in tree data
- [ ] FastAPI backend accessible for proof fetching

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: npm install fails
**Check**:
- Node version (should be 18+ for Next.js 14)
- Run `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then retry

### Issue: Sidebar not visible
**Check**:
- User is logged in (check session)
- MongoDB connection in console
- Browser console for errors
- Z-index conflicts with other components

### Issue: No predictions showing
**Check**:
- MongoDB has prediction logs for user
- API route returns data (check Network tab)
- User email matches in database
- `predictionLogs` array is not empty

### Issue: Tree not rendering
**Check**:
- `merkleTree.hierarchicalStructure` exists
- `levels` array is present
- React Flow styles imported in `globals.css`
- No console errors

### Issue: Proof fetching fails
**Check**:
- Backend URL correct in `.env.local`
- FastAPI backend is running
- Transaction hash format (starts with `0x`)
- Network tab shows API call
- CORS is enabled on backend

### Issue: Copy not working
**Check**:
- Running on HTTPS or localhost
- Clipboard API permissions
- Browser supports clipboard API
- Check console for security errors

## 🎯 Feature Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time User
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Sidebar shows "No prediction logs yet"
4. Upload a CSV file
5. After processing, prediction appears in sidebar
6. Expand the prediction to see tree

### Scenario 2: Returning User with Data
1. Log in with account that has predictions
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Sidebar shows list of past predictions
4. Click different predictions to expand
5. Verify dates, amounts, and hashes are correct

### Scenario 3: Merkle Verification
1. Expand a prediction card
2. Tree renders with 28 leaf nodes
3. Click a leaf node (e.g., Day 5)
4. Wait for proof to fetch (~300ms)
5. Proof path highlights in red
6. Verification steps display
7. Selected node shows in yellow
8. Repeat with different leaf node

### Scenario 4: Multi-Prediction Management
1. Have 3+ predictions in sidebar
2. Expand one prediction
3. Expand a different prediction
4. Verify only one is expanded at a time
5. Close expanded prediction
6. All predictions return to collapsed state

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks
