## How to Use the Email Node

### Step 1: Create Email Node in Workflow

### Step 2: Upload Your Email List
- Click "Upload Email List (CSV)" button on the email node
- Select your CSV file (must have `email` column)
- Optional: Include `name` column for personalization

### Step 3: Run the Node
- Click "Run Agent"
- AI generates professional email content
- Emails are sent to all recipients
- View statistics in node output

## CSV File Format

Your CSV must have at least an `email` column:

```csv
email,name
john@example.com,John Doe
jane@company.io,Jane Smith
alice@startup.com,Alice Johnson
```

**Use the provided `sample-email-list.csv` file for testing!**

## Free Tier Limits

- **100 emails per day**
- **3,000 emails per month**
- Perfect for testing and small campaigns

## For Production Use (Optional)

To send from your own domain instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`:

1. Add your domain in Resend dashboard
2. Configure DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
3. Wait 24-48 hours for verification
4. Update `EMAIL_FROM` in `.env.local`
